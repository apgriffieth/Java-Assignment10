In this program, a menu is displayed to the user and performs the chosen task. It will continue to ask for another input until the user inputs 'Q'. Using a LinkedList, the user can insert, get, set, and remove an element by index, insert at the front, insert before an element, append at the end, append after an element, reverse a specified number of elements in the list, remove duplicates, list the current size, and print the list.
